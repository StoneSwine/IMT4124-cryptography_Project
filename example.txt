n her role as Director, Stevenson was responsible for training, morale and welfare of all WAAAF staff.[13] Philosophically committed to equal opportunity regardless of gender and social background,[14] from the outset she had to deal with discrimination by government authorities, many of whom had been against the creation of such a service. The Minister for Defence, Harold Thorby, declared that "aviation takes women out of their natural environment, the home and the training of the family",[5] and several senior Air Force officers, including the man later known as the "Father of the RAAF", Air Marshal Richard Williams, and the Director of Personnel Services, Group Captain Joe Hewitt, also fought the proposal. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, a Royal Air Force commander who appreciated how the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) had proved itself during the Battle of Britain in 1940, supported its establishment but lost some interest after his preferred choice as Director, his daughter Sybil-Jean, a serving WAAF officer, was ruled out. The Federal government decreed that WAAAF staff would be paid two-thirds of what a male doing the equivalent trade received. They could be arbitrarily dismissed for disciplinary offences without recourse to a court-martial, could only enter RAAF messes by invitation, and could expect to be saluted as a courtesy, not as a rule. Author Joyce Thomson contends that such conditions made the women "uniformed civilians".[15] Women were at first enrolled for renewable twelve-month periods rather than enlisted as permanent staff; only in 1943 did the WAAAF become part of the Permanent Air Force.[10]Stevenson considered housing, uniforms, and recruit training to be her first priorities after taking up her appointment. On arriving at No. 1 WAAAF Depot in Malvern, Victoria, she was "shattered at the prison-like atmosphere of the place".[16] She drew on her retail experience to organise the WAAAF and to design its uniform.[14] Stevenson was promoted to wing officer on 1 October 1941, and group officer on 1 April 1942,[3] which was to be the highest rank attained by a serving WAAAF member.[17] She took an active interest in recruitment, her liberal social outlook evinced by her determination that single women with children should not be barred from entry to the WAAAF.[18] To establish high standards, Stevenson personally interviewed all WAAAF officer trainees and briefed as many of them as possible before they were posted to a new job.[19][20] She was quoted in the Adelaide Advertiser as saying, "When interviewing applicants, I always point out the hardships of the service, so that no one will come in on a rush of enthusiasm and regret it later."[21] Stevenson also worked to maintain the morale of personnel, encouraging officers to attend group leadership courses and organise leisure and sporting activities for their staff.[22] Colonel Sybil Irving, the head of the Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS), who observed first hand the WAAAF's training methods before large-scale AWAS recruitment commenced, later declared that Stevenson "did the most pertinent pioneering work" in gaining acceptance for women in the armed forces.[1][23] For her part, Stevenson considered the role of Director "a difficult job and often a lonely one".[24]Later serviceTwo women and three men flanked by two lines of women in dark military uniformsStevenson (centre), flanked by the American First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt (left), and Air Commodore Frank Lukis (right), September 1943Early in 1943 a policy change was mooted to remove female officers from the technical musterings they had so far filled in the WAAAF, and substitute male officers in these roles. In opposing this, Stevenson went around the new Air Member for Personnel, Air Commodore Frank Lukis, and wrote directly to the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Commodore John McCauley. She told McCauley, "I contend that it is a waste of money and training to take women cipher officers, women from Signals (S4) and casualty ... when they have learnt their work and substitute these women by men who have to learn the job", and recommended that he direct the Air Member for Personnel to ensure that female officers continued to be employed in technical positions, and not simply for administration and welfare. McCauley agreed with Stevenson but Lukis appealed to Air Vice Marshal George Jones, the Chief of the Air Staff. Jones backed Lukis' authority, and the latter sent what Joyce Thomson described as a "stinging rebuke" to Stevenson, who was forced to apologise.[25] In any event, women officers continued to be employed in technical positions as the WAAAF expanded over the next two years, peaking in strength at 18,667 members in October 1944.[6][26] As of July that year, women comprised thirty-one per cent of Air Force ground staff and filled sixty-one trades, all previously occupied by men. By the end of the war around 27,000 women had served in the WAAAF.[5]In a July 1945 performance assessment, Joe Hewitt, now an air commodore and the Air Member for Personnel, wrote that Stevenson had "displayed great keenness in the performance of her duties and considerable resourcefulness in the solution of difficult problems".[27] She continued to lead the WAAAF following the cessation of hostilities, retiring on medical grounds on 22 March 1946.[5][6] Suffering reduced muscle function in her left arm and pain on the left side of her face and neck, she was diagnosed with brachial neuritis, traced to typhus, tetanus and smallpox injections received the previous May in preparation for a proposed visit to Manila that never eventuated. In her last annual address to the WAAAF as its Director, Stevenson encouraged its members to make use of their service experience when they returned to civilian life:[28]These are the things we shall miss—the comradeship, the knowledge of a common aim, the feeling that one is not alone—they all make life in the WAAAF very different from life in the outside world ... We must find a common aim—not of winning a war and working to free our prisoners of war—but winning something for our district from an unenlightened council or a disinterested public ...To The Sydney Morning Herald, she contended:[29]Waaafs also succeeded in making a few old truisms into lies ... It can never be said again that women cannot keep secrets, for in the WAAAF they did confidential work and kept top secrets. Nor can it be said that women cannot work and live together without squabbling or that women will not take orders from women.Presented with a jewelled brooch as a farewell gift by her fellow officers, Stevenson asked that its value instead be put towards a scholarship for an ex-WAAAF member to study social work at the University of Sydney.[30] The WAAAF itself, the first and largest of Australia's wartime women's services, was disbanded on 30 September 1946.[6][31] It was succeeded in 1950 by a new organisation with a separate charter to the RAAF, the Women's Royal Australian Air Force (WRAAF). WRAAF members achieved a pay scale equal to the male service in 1972, and five years later were integrated with the RAAF. William M. Branham was born near Burkesville, Kentucky, on April 6, 1909,[4][5][6] the son of Charles and Ella Harvey Branham, the oldest of ten children.[7][a] He claimed that at his birth, a "Light come [sic] whirling through the window, about the size of a pillow, and circled around where I was, and went down on the bed".[5] Branham told his publicist Gordon Lindsay that he had mystical experiences from an early age;[4] and that at age three he heard a "voice" speaking to him from a tree telling him "he would live near a city called New Albany".[4][5] According to Branham, that year his family moved to Jeffersonville, Indiana.[5] Branham also said that when he was seven years old, God told him to avoid smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages.[4][9] Branham stated he never violated the command.[4]Branham's father was an alcoholic, and he grew up in "deep poverty" much like their neighbors.[4] As a child, he would often wear a coat held closed only by safety pins, without a shirt underneath.[6] Branham's neighbors reported him as "someone who always seemed a little different", but said he was a dependable youth.[4] His tendency towards "mystical experiences and moral purity" caused misunderstandings among his friends, family, and other young people; he was a "black sheep" from an early age.[10] Branham called his childhood "a terrible life."[9]At 19, Branham left home seeking a better life. He traveled to Phoenix, Arizona, where he worked for two years on a ranch and began a successful career in boxing.[4] He returned to Jeffersonville when his brother died in 1929.[4][11] Branham had no experience with religion as a child; he said the first time he heard a prayer was at his brother's funeral.[12] Soon after, while working for the Public Service Company of Indiana, Branham was almost killed when he was overcome by gas.[12] While recovering from the accident, he said he again heard a voice leading him to begin seeking God.[12] He began attending a local Independent Baptist church, the First Pentecostal Baptist Church of Jeffersonville, where he converted to Christianity.[13][4] Six months later, he was ordained as an Independent Baptist minister.[4] His early ministry was an "impressive success"; he quickly attracted a small group of followers, who helped obtain a tent in which he could hold a revival.[4]At the time of Branham's conversion, the First Pentecostal Baptist Church of Jeffersonville was a nominally Baptist church that observed some Pentecostal doctrines, including divine healing.[14] As a result, he may have been exposed to some Pentecostal teachings from his conversion.[15] He was first exposed to a Pentecostal denominational church in 1936, which invited him to join, but he refused.[14][b]During June 1933, Branham held revival meetings in his tent.[4] On June 2 that year, the Jeffersonville Evening News said the Branham campaign reported 14 converts.[17] His followers believed his ministry was accompanied by miraculous signs from its beginning, and that when he was baptizing converts on June 11, 1933, in the Ohio River near Jeffersonville, a bright light descended over him and that he heard a voice say, "As John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Jesus Christ, so your message will forerun His second coming".[18][19] Belief in the baptismal story is a critical element of faith among Branham's followers.[20] Branham initially interpreted this in reference to the restoration of the gifts of the spirit to the church and made regular references to the baptismal story from the earliest days of the healing revival.[21] In later years, Branham also connected the story to his teaching ministry.[22] Baptist historian Doug Weaver said Branham might have embellished the baptismal story when he was achieving success in the healing revival.[23]The front of a brick building with white double doors and windows on either side and a sign above the doorBranham Tabernacle c. 1935Following his June tent meeting, Branham's supporters helped him organize a new church, the Branham Tabernacle, in Jeffersonville.[24] Branham served as pastor from 1933 to 1946.[24] The church flourished at first, but its growth began to slow. Because of the Great Depression, it was often short of funds, so Branham served without compensation.[24] Branham believed the stagnation of the church's growth was a punishment from God for his failure to embrace Pentecostalism.[24] Branham married Amelia Hope Brumbach (b. July 16, 1913) in 1934, and they had two children; William "Billy" Paul Branham (b. September 13, 1935) and Sharon Rose Branham (b. October 27, 1936).[7] Branham's wife died on July 22, 1937, and their daughter died four days later (July 26, 1937), shortly after the Ohio River flood of 1937.[25] Branham interpreted their deaths as God's punishment for his continued resistance to holding revivals for the Oneness Pentecostals.[18][c]Branham married Meda Marie Broy in 1941, and together they had three children; Rebekah (b. 1946), Sarah (b. 1950), and Joseph (b. 1955). Branham held his first meetings as a faith healer in 1946.[33] His healing services are well documented, and he is regarded as the pacesetter for those who followed him.[34] At the time they were held, Branham's revival meetings were the largest religious meetings some American cities he visited had ever seen;[35] reports of 1,000 to 1,500 converts per meeting were common.[35] Historians name his June 1946 St. Louis meetings as the inauguration of the healing revival period.[36] He said he had received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946, commissioning his worldwide ministry.[37] In his later years, in an attempt to link his ministry with the end time, he connected his vision with the establishment of the nation of Israel, at one point mistakenly stating the vision occurred on the same day.[38][38][d][e]His first revival meetings were held over 12 days during June 1946 in St. Louis.[41] His first campaign manager, W. E. Kidston, was editor of The Apostolic Herald and had many contacts in the Pentecostal movement.[41] Kidston was instrumental in helping organize Branham's early revival meetings.[41] Time magazine reported on his St. Louis campaign meetings,[42] and according to the article, Branham drew a crowd of over 4,000 sick people who desired healing and recorded him diligently praying for each.[41] Branham's fame began to grow as a result of the publicity and reports covering his meetings.[41] Following the St. Louis meetings, Branham launched a tour of small Oneness Pentecostal churches across the Midwest and southern United States, from which stemmed reports of healing and one report of a resurrection.[41] By August his fame had spread widely. He held meetings that month in Jonesboro, Arkansas and drew a crowd of 25,000 with attendees from 28 different states.[43] The size of the crowds presented a problem for Branham's team as they found it difficult to find venues that could seat large numbers of attendees.[43]Thousands of spectators in a large arena look towards a man standing behind a podium on a platformF. F. Bosworth counsels attendees on the doctrine of divine healing at a Branham Campaign meeting in Tacoma, Washington, April 1948.Branham's revivals were interracial from their inception and were noted for their "racial openness" during the period of widespread racial unrest.[44] An African American minister participating in the St. Louis meetings claimed to be healed during the revival, helping to bring Branham a sizable African American following from the early days of the revival. Dedicated to ministering to both races, Branham insisted on holding interracial meetings even in the southern states. To satisfy segregation laws when ministering in the south, Branham's team would use a rope to divide the crowd by race.[44]After holding a very successful revival meeting in Shreveport during mid-1947, Branham began assembling an evangelical team that stayed with him for most of the revival period.[45] The first addition to the team was Jack Moore and Young Brown, who periodically assisted him in managing his meetings.[46] Following the Shreveport meetings, Branham held a series of meetings in San Antonio, Phoenix, and at various locations in California.[45] Moore invited his friend Gordon Lindsay to join the campaign team, which he did beginning at a meeting in Sacramento, California, in late 1947.[46] Lindsay was a successful publicist and manager for Branham, and played a key role in helping him gain national and international recognition.[47][48]In 1948, Branham and Lindsay founded Voice of Healing magazine, which was originally aimed at reporting Branham's healing campaigns.[47][f] Lindsay was impressed with Branham's focus on humility and unity, and was instrumental in helping him gain acceptance among Trinitarian and Oneness Pentecostal groups by expanding his revival meetings beyond the United Pentecostal Church to include all of the major Pentecostal groups.[49][42]The front page of the Voice of Healing magazine with headline stating; "Branham Campaign stirs Pensacola and Kansas City"April 1948 cover of Voice of Healing magazineThe first meetings organized by Lindsay were held in northwestern North America during late 1947.[46][42] At the first of these meetings, held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canadian minister Ern Baxter joined Branham's team.[46] Lindsay reported 70,000 attendees to the 14 days of meetings and long prayer lines as Branham prayed for the sick.[46] William Hawtin, a Canadian Pentecostal minister, attended one of Branham's Vancouver meetings in November 1947 and was impressed by Branham's healings. Branham thus became an influence on the Latter Rain revival movement, which Hawtin helped initiate.[50] In January 1948, meetings were held in Florida;[46] F. F. Bosworth met Branham at the meetings and also joined his team.[51] Bosworth was among the pre-eminent ministers of the Pentecostal movement and lent great weight to Branham's campaign team.[51] He remained a strong Branham supporter until his death in 1958.[51] Bosworth endorsed Branham as "the most sensitive person to the presence and working of the Holy Spirit" he had ever met.[52][53] During early 1947, a major campaign was held in Kansas City, where Branham and Lindsay first met Oral Roberts.[46] Roberts and Branham had contact at different points during the revival.[54] Roberts said Branham was "set apart, just like Moses".[54]Five men wearing suites stand side by sideFrom left: Young Brown, Jack Moore, William Branham, Oral Roberts, Gordon Lindsay; photo taken at Kansas City in 1948Branham spent many hours ministering and praying for the sick during his campaigns, and like many other leading evangelists of the time he suffered exhaustion.[55] After one year of campaigning, his exhaustion began leading to health issues.[56] Attendees reported seeing him "staggering from intense fatigue" during his last meetings.[46] Just as Branham began to attract international attention in May 1948, he announced that due to illness he would have to halt his campaign.[46][57] His illness shocked the growing movement,[58] and his abrupt departure from the field caused a rift between him and Lindsay over the Voice of Healing magazine.[46] Branham insisted that Lindsay take over complete management of the publication.[46] With the main subject of the magazine no longer actively campaigning, Lindsay was forced to seek other ministers to promote.[46] He decided to publicize Oral Roberts during Branham's absence, and Roberts quickly rose to prominence, in large part due to Lindsay's coverage.[51]Branham partially recovered from his illness and resumed holding meetings in October 1948; in that month he held a series of meetings around the United States without Lindsay's support.[51] Branham's return to the movement led to his resumed leadership of it.[51] In November 1948, he met with Lindsay and Moore and told them he had received another angelic visitation, instructing him to hold a series of meetings across the United States and then to begin holding meetings internationally.[59] As a result of the meeting, Lindsay rejoined Branham's campaigning team.[59]StyleTwo men stand facing each other on a platform as thousands of spectators on the ground floor and a balcony watchBranham at a healing campaign meetingMost revivalists of the era were flamboyant but Branham was usually calm and spoke quietly, only occasionally raising his voice.[54] His preaching style was described as "halting and simple", and crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitation and "constant communication with God".[28] He refused to discuss controversial doctrinal issues during the early years of his campaigns,[60][61] and issued a policy statement that he would only minister on the "great evangelical truths".[62] He insisted his calling was to bring unity among the different churches he was ministering to and to urge the churches to return to the roots of early Christianity.[54]In the first part of his meetings, one of Branham's companion evangelists would preach a sermon.[46] Ern Baxter or F. F. Bosworth usually filled this role, but other ministers also participated in Branham's campaigns.[46] Baxter generally focused on bible teaching; Bosworth counseled supplicants on the need for faith and the doctrine of divine healing.[63] Following their build-up, Branham would take the podium and deliver a short sermon,[46] in which he usually related stories about his personal life experiences.[60] After completing his sermon, he would proceed with a prayer line where he would pray for the sick.[54] Branham would often request God to "confirm his message with two-or-three faith inspired miracles".[63] His campaign manager organized the prayer line, sending supplicants forward to be prayed for on stage individually.[63] Branham generally prayed for a few people each night and believed witnessing the results on the stage would inspire faith in the audience and permit them to experience similar results without having to be personally prayed for.[64] Describing Branham's method, Bosworth said "he does not begin to pray for the healing of the afflicted in body in the healing line each night until God anoints him for the operation of the gift, and until he is conscious of the presence of the Angel with him on the platform. Without this consciousness he seems to be perfectly helpless."[65]Branham told audiences the angel that commissioned his ministry had given him two signs by which they could prove his commission.[65] He described the first sign as vibrations he felt in his hand when he touched a sick person's hand, which communicated to him the nature of the illness, but did not guarantee healing.[65][66] Branham's use of what his fellow evangelists called a word of knowledge gift separated him from his contemporaries.[33][60] This second sign did not appear in his campaigns until after his recovery in 1948, and was used to "amaze tens of thousands" at his meetings.[60] According to Bosworth, this gift of knowledge allowed Branham "to see and enable him to tell the many events of [people's] lives from their childhood down to the present".[60][67] This caused many in the healing revival to view Branham as a "seer like the old testament prophets".[60] Branham amazed even fellow evangelists, which served to further push him into a legendary status in the movement.[60] Branham's audiences were often awestruck by the events during his meetings.[54][68] At the peak of his popularity in the 1950s, Branham was widely adored and "the neo-Pentecostal world believed Branham to be a prophet to their generation".[53]OppositionBranham faced criticism and opposition from the early days of the healing campaign.[69] According to historian Ronald Kydd, Branham evoked strong opinions from people with whom he came into contact; "most people either loved him or hated him".[70][71] In 1947, Rev. Alfred Pohl, a minister in Saskatchewan, Canada, stated that many people Branham pronounced as healed later died.[69] A year later, W. J. Taylor, a district superintendent with the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, raised the same concern and asked for a thorough investigation.[72] Taylor presented evidence that claims of the number of people healed were vastly overestimated.[61] He stated, "there is a possibility that this whole thing is wrong".[73][72] The number of people who claimed to be healed in Branham's campaign meetings "is impossible to approximate" and the numbers vary greatly between sources.[74] According to Kydd, by watching films of the revival meetings, "the viewer would assume almost everyone was healed" but the results proved otherwise the few times follow-up was made.[75] No consistent record of follow-ups was made, making analysis of the claims difficult to subsequent researchers.[75] Pentecostal historian Walter Hollenweger said, "very few were actually healed".[76] Some attendees of Branham's meetings believed the healings were a hoax and accused him of selectively choosing who could enter the prayer line.[77] Some people left his meetings disappointed after finding Branham's conviction that everyone in the audience could be healed without being in the prayer line proved incorrect.[77] Branham generally attributed the failure of supplicants to receive healing to their lack of faith.[78]The "word of knowledge" gift was likewise subject to much criticism.[70] Hollenweger investigated Branham's use of the "word of knowledge gift" and found no instances in which Branham was mistaken in his often-detailed pronouncements.[70] Criticism of Branham's use of this gift was primarily around its nature; some accused him of witchcraft and telepathy.[75] Branham was openly confronted with such criticisms and rejected the assertions.[75]Growing fameA man stands at a podium with a light colored object above his headBranham at the Sam Houston Coliseum in 1950In January 1950, Branham's campaign team held their Houston campaign, one of the most significant series of meetings of the revival.[51] The location of their first meeting was too small to accommodate the approximately 8,000 attendees, and they had to relocate to the Sam Houston Coliseum.[51] On the night of January 24, 1950, Branham was photographed during a debate between Bosworth and local Baptist minister W. E. Best regarding the theology of divine healing.[79][59] Bosworth argued in favor, while Best argued against.[79] The photograph showed a light above Branham's head, which he and his associates believed to be supernatural.[79][59] The photograph became well-known in the revival movement and is regarded by Branham's followers as an iconic relic.[72] Branham believed the light was a divine vindication of his ministry;[79] others believed it was a glare from the venue's overhead lighting.[80]A middle-aged man dressed in a suit leans on crutchesCongressman William UpshawIn January 1951, US Congressman William Upshaw, who had been crippled for 59 years as the result of an accident, said he was miraculously healed and had regained the ability to walk in a Branham meeting, further fueling Branham's fame.[72] Upshaw sent a letter describing his healing claim to each member of Congress.[81][72] Among the widespread media reports was a story in the Los Angeles Times that described it as "perhaps the most effective healing testimony this generation has ever seen".[81] Upshaw died in November 1952, at the age of 86.[82]Branham's meetings were regularly attended by journalists,[83] who wrote articles about the miracles reported by Branham and his team throughout the years of his revivals, and claimed patients were cured of various ailments after attending prayer meetings with Branham.[83] Durban Sunday Tribune and The Natal Mercury reported wheelchair-bound people rising and walking.[84][85] Winnipeg Free Press reported a girl was cured of deafness.[86] El Paso Herald-Post reported hundreds of attendees at one meeting seeking divine healing.[87] Logansport Press reported a father's claim that his four-year-old son, who suffered from a "rare brain ailment", benefited from Branham's meetings.[88] Despite such occasional glowing reports, most of the press coverage Branham received was negative.[89]According to Hollenweger, "Branham filled the largest stadiums and meeting halls in the world" during his five major international campaigns.[59][89] Branham held his first series of campaigns in Europe during April 1950 with meetings in Finland, Sweden, and Norway.[90][59] Attendance at the meetings generally exceeded 7,000 despite resistance to his meetings by the state churches.[62] In Norway, the Directorate of Health forbade Branham from laying hands on the sick and sent police to his meetings to enforce the order.[91] Branham was the first American deliverance minister to successfully tour in Europe.[92] A 1952 campaign in South Africa had the largest attendance in Branham's career, with an estimated 200,000 attendees.[62][93] According to Lindsay, the altar call at his Durban meeting received 30,000 converts.[62] During international campaigns in 1954, Branham visited Portugal, Italy, and India.[62] Branham's final major overseas tour in 1955 included visits to Switzerland and Germany.[94]Financial difficultiesIn 1955, Branham's campaigning career began to slow following financial setbacks.[53][95] Even after he became famous, Branham continued to wear inexpensive suits and refused large salaries; he was not interested in amassing wealth as part of his ministry[6] and was reluctant to solicit donations during his meetings.[96] During the early years of his campaigns, donations had been able to cover costs, but from 1955, donations failed to cover the costs of three successive campaigns,[53] one of which incurred a $15,000 deficit.[95] Some of Branham's business associates thought he was partially responsible because of his lack of interest in the financial affairs of the campaigns and tried to hold him personally responsible for the debt.[53] Branham briefly stopped campaigning and said he would have to take a job to repay the debt, but the Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International ultimately offered financial assistance to cover the debt.[96] Branham became increasingly reliant on the Full Gospel Businessmen to finance his campaign meetings as the Pentecostal denominations began to withdraw their financial support.[96]Finances became an issue again in 1956 when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) charged Branham with tax evasion.[53] The American government targeted the other leading revivalists with lawsuits during the same time period, including Oral Roberts, Jack Coe, and A. A. Allen.[97] The IRS asserted income reported by the ministers as non-taxable gifts was taxable,[95] despite the fact Branham had not kept the gifts for himself.[98] Except Allen, who won his legal battle, the evangelists settled their cases out of court.[95] The IRS investigation showed Branham did not pay close attention to the amount of money flowing through his ministry.[99] It also revealed that others were taking advantage of him.[99] Branham's annual salary was $7,000 while his manager's was $80,000.[95] Oral Roberts earned a salary of $15,000 in the same years.[100] The case was eventually settled out of court with the payment of a $40,000 penalty.[53][101] Branham was never able to completely pay off the debt.[53][101] Amid the financial issues, Lindsay left Branham's campaign team. Branham eventually criticized the Voice of Healing magazine as a "massive financial organization" that put making money ahead of promoting good.[58]End of the revivalBy the mid-1950s, dozens of the ministers associated with Branham and his campaigns had launched similar healing campaigns.[102] In 1956, the healing revival reached its peak, as 49 separate evangelists held major meetings.[103] Through the Voice of Healing magazine, Branham and Lindsay ineffectively attempted to discourage their activities by saying Branham wished they would help their local churches rather than launch national careers.[102] The swelling number of competitors and emulators further reduced attendance at Branham's meetings.[102] His correspondence also decreased sharply; whereas he had once received "a thousand letters a day", his mail dropped to 75 letters a day but Branham thought the decline was temporary.[104] He continued expecting something greater, which he said "nobody will be able to imitate".[102] In 1955, he reported a vision of a renewed tent ministry and a "third pull which would be dramatically different" than his earlier career.[102]Among Branham's emulators was Jim Jones, the founder and leader of the Peoples Temple.[105] According to Historian Catherine Wessinger, while rejecting Christianity as a false religion, Jones covertly used popular Christian figures to advance his own ideology.[106] To draw the crowds he was seeking, Jones needed a religious headliner and invited Branham to share the platform with him at a self-organized religious convention held at the Cadle Tabernacle auditorium in Indianapolis from June 11 to 15, 1956.[105] Branham critics Peter Duyzer and John Collins reported that Branham "performed numerous miracles", drawing a crowd of 11,000.[107] Jones later became known for the mass murder and suicide at Jonestown in November 1978.[105] According to Collins, Jim Jones and Paul Schäfer were influenced to move to South America by Branham's 1961 prophecy concerning Armageddon, but utlimately concluded that Jones and Branham "did not see eye to eye", and that Jones rejected Branham as a dishonest person.[108][109][g]By 1960, the number of evangelists holding national campaigns dropped to 11.[103] Several perspectives on the decline of the healing revival have been offered. Crowder suggested Branham's gradual separation from Gordon Lindsay played a major part in the decline.[111] Harrell attributed the decline to the increasing number of evangelists crowding the field and straining the financial resources of the Pentecostal denominations.[102] Weaver agreed Pentecostal churches gradually withdrew their support for the healing revival, mainly over the financial stresses put on local churches by the healing campaigns.[112] The Assemblies of God were the first to openly withdraw support from the healing revival in 1953.[112] Weaver pointed to other factors that may have helped destroy the initial ecumenism of the revival; tension between the independent evangelists and the Pentecostal churches caused by the evangelists' fund-raising methods, denominational pride, sensationalism, and doctrinal conflicts—particularly between the Oneness and Trinitarian factions within Pentecostalism.
